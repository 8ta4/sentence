# sentence

## Make Sentence Make Sense

`sentence` is sentence motions and text objects built for prose.

## Setup

> How do I set up `sentence`?

1. Make sure you're using [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

1. Add this block to your `lazy.nvim` configuration:

    ```lua
    {
      "8ta4/sentence",
    }
    ```

## Usage

> Will the `)` motion stop on blank lines?

No. The `)` motion bypasses blank lines. This keeps you moving between thoughts, instead of landing on dead space.

> From Normal mode, can `vis` select anything if the cursor is on a blank line?

Yes. Instead of selecting nothing on a blank line, `vis` selects the next sentence, if one exists.

> From Normal mode, with the cursor on a sentence, does `vas` select its trailing whitespace?

Yes. `as` selects the trailing whitespace, so operations like `das` don't leave your text messy. `is` selects only the sentence text. This gives `is` and `as` distinct purposes, so you're not wasting keys on redundant behavior.

> From Normal mode, with the cursor on a sentence, can `vas` select leading whitespace?

Yeah. If there's no trailing whitespace after the sentence, `as` grabs the leading whitespace before it instead. This way, `das` doesn't leave your text messy, and `is` and `as` stay distinct.

> Are there cases where `sentence` does not treat a period as a sentence end?

Yeah. There are a few.

- The period belongs to an unambiguous abbreviation like `Mr.`, `Dr.`, `Mrs.` or `Ms.`, and there is non-whitespace text after it on the same line.

- The line starts with optional indentation followed by one or more digits and a single period, and there is non-whitespace text after the period on the same line.

- The period is followed by any number of `)`, `]`, `"` or `'`.

`sentence` avoids rules for ambiguous cases like `Jr.` because those kinds of rules could lead the plugin to treat two separate linguistic sentences as one. That way, the rules stay simple.
